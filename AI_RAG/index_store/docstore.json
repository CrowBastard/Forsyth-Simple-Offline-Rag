For this assignment they were to conduct research on a variety of Roman public buildings in groups, build digital \nreconstructions of them using the Unity 3D game engine, and present them to the class in the form of a virtual reality (VR) simulation. In \ndoing so, students were able to create a virtual built environment based on their research, navigate it, and discuss the space with a sense of \nimmersion and scale. Using this experiment as a case study, the goal of this article is twofold: firstly, to assess the pedagogical efficacy of \nconstructionist approaches to teaching students about Roman architecture, specifically using VR and video game design technology. The \nsecond goal is to address the technical and pedagogical challenges of using game design software in the classroom and to propose ways in \nwhich this assignment can be improved in the future.\nKeywords: Video Game Design, Classics, Ancient History, Virtual Reality, Digital Humanities, Teaching\nIntroduction\nFor a number of decades now there has been much scholarly \ndiscussion in the fields of cognitive behaviour and education about \nthe benefits of pedagogical approaches that favour design over \ninstruction \u2013 that is to say, learning experiences in which students \nactively design learning material instead of simply consuming \nmaterial designed to transmit knowledge to them. This approach is \nbest exemplified in Seymour Papert\u2019s concept of constructionism, \nwhich stresses the importance of \u2018learning-by-making\u2019 and, in the \ncase of Papert\u2019s work in the fields of mathematics and computer \nscience, using digital-media as a tool to achieve constructionist \nlearning goals (Kafai, 1995; Papert, 1980, 1993). In this respect, the \nconstructionist approach encourages learners to build knowledge \nout of their experiences, especially when they are constructing \nobjects or artifacts. With the advent of social media platforms such \nas Y outube, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok, user-generated content \nhas become the most commonly created and consumed form of \nmedia in many of our daily lives. Based on the fact that an entire \ngeneration born into a world of user-generated digital content will \nsoon fill the seats of classrooms at colleges and universities \nworldwide, it seems more appropriate than ever to explore the \nbenefits of constructionist learning approaches using digital media \ntechnologies in higher education.\nIn addition, the recent proliferation of consumer-grade virtual \nreality (VR) hardware has made a wide range of immersive \nexperiences, locations, and environments more accessible than \never. This is especially beneficial for students of ancient history and \narchaeology who may not be able to examine archaeological \nmaterials and environments in person due to the prohibitive costs \nof travel, general inaccessibility of archaeological materials, and \nmore recently due to the global pandemic.

Through a qualitative \nanalysis of the students\u2019 response papers, course evaluation \ncomments, classroom observations, and the 3D renditions of \nRoman buildings that the participants constructed, the goal of this \narticle is twofold: the first goal is to assess the pedagogical efficacy \nof constructionist approaches to teaching students about Roman \narchitecture, specifically using VR and video game design \ntechnology. The second goal is to address the technical and \npedagogical challenges of using game design software in the \nclassroom and to propose ways in which this assignment can be \nimproved in the future.\nConstructionism and Video Game Design\nBuilding upon Jean Piaget\u2019s concept of constructivism, Seymour \nPapert popularised the concept of constructionism, which argues \nthat a good way to construct knowledge in one\u2019s own mind is to \nconstruct something in the physical world (Papert, 1980 ; Piaget, \n1957, 1964). This teaching philosophy stands in opposition to \ninstructionism, a pedagogical philosophy in which the teacher \ntransmits knowledge to the students who receive this knowledge \npassively (Kafai, 2006, pp. 36\u201337). Since the 1980s, a significant \nnumber of pedagogical experiments testing the constructionist \nmodel have been conducted (Gee, 2004; Ke, 2016). In many of these \nexperiments, students have used video game design software in \norder to build games designed for teaching concepts, usually of a \nmathematical or scientific nature, to other students. For example, \nin the 1990s Y asmin Kafai\u2019s experiments had fourth grade students \ndesign video games to teach the concept of fractions to younger \nstudents (Kafai, 1995, 2006; Kafai and Burke, 2017). More recently, \nQing Li has used a similar approach to teach 7\u201311-year-old children \nabout the laws of Newtonian physics through game design and \nFengfeng Ke studied the effects of design-based learning on middle \nschool students\u2019 disposition toward the subject of mathematics, \nwith positive results (Ke, 2014 ). Ke noted that after students \ndesigned their mathematical games, they had a more positive \ndisposition toward the subject matter being taught (Ke, 2014, p. 37). \nLi, likewise, noted that her students adopted a generally positive \ndisposition toward the subject of Physics following the experiment. \nShe also added that game design elements enhanced the learning of \ngeneric design skills and collaboration in addition to the assigned \ntopic (Li, 2010, p. 40).\nOther experiments have demonstrated that design-based \nlearning improves problem solving and have also shown results \nsupporting the constructionist learning approach. Separate studies \nconducted by Ben DeVane et al. and Matt Akcaoglu concluded that \ngame design by itself is an effective tool for teaching complex \nproblem-solving skills to pre-teen children, providing empirical \nevidence for some cognitive benefits of game design activities \n(Akcaoglu, 2014, pp. 597\u2013598; DeVane et al ., 2016, pp. 45\u201347; cf. \nKolodner et al., 2003). Very few studies, however, have tested the \nefficacy of teaching topics in the humanities through game design \nor using constructionist approaches to teaching. Yunjo An\u2019s 2016  \nstudy is one such example. In this study, seventh grade students \nused the Gamestar Mechanic software to build games on the topic \nof containing communism. While she observed that the students \nexercised positive attitudes and creative behaviours, they had \ntrouble incorporating social studies content into their creations \n(An, 2016, p. 562). Moreover, with the exception of some studies \ninvolving groups of teachers, the majority of constructionist \nteaching experiments involving game design software have \ninvolved pre-teen students as test subjects (Kafai et al ., 1998; Li, \n2012). There is a considerable gap, therefore, in scholarship \nexploring the efficacy of game design as a learning tool in the \nhumanities at the university level. For that reason, the aim of this \nstudy is to assess the efficacy of the constructionist teaching \napproach and game design technology as a tool for teaching \nAncient History at the university level.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4251, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "431b1429-9a6c-4cf6-86be-a0a0d6ddb095": {"__data__": {"id_": "431b1429-9a6c-4cf6-86be-a0a0d6ddb095", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d915bc18-eb18-442c-85b7-dbc8c5649046", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "hash": "792e5a64a452ccb30324c691d33cc1e12c9a984027c71e6c2bca9ff406542c3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3dc87795-951f-4c77-865e-d75bbdfe14b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "hash": "0a767d6580f1fd02dcd4b430839959ad40bf9e5ab4f1d05ed0b8beef0e4d77c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "While she observed that the students \nexercised positive attitudes and creative behaviours, they had \ntrouble incorporating social studies content into their creations \n(An, 2016, p. 562).

For the sake of this study, \nthe discussion of \u2018efficacy\u2019 will be gauged based on the following \nquestions:\n(1) To what extent did students successfully design Roman public \nbuildings in a way that reflected diligent research on their \nassigned building type? Did students successfully incorporate \nlearning content in the design process?\n(2) Did the assignment and its technical components meet the \nlearning requirements and expectations of the students? Was it \nengaging? Did it create enthusiasm about the topic? Did the \nstudents demonstrate the necessary technical abilities to \ncomplete the assignment?\n(3) To what extent did the design elements of the assignment \nobscure the focus on historical content? Does the incorporation \nof game design take anything away from learning Ancient \nHistory?\nMethodology\nThe Unity 3D game engine was chosen for this experiment because \nof its intuitive object-manipulation functions, the depth of online \nsupport, and because I had previous experience using the SteamVR \nSDK (software development kit) in Unity 3D to build other VR \nprojects. One of the drawbacks of this, however, is that Unity 3D is \na professional grade video game engine, so the steep learning curve \nfor the students was a risk that was taken in lieu of using a simplified \ngame engine such as the ones used in other design-based learning \nstudies discussed above. Other educational experiments involving \ngame design typically use simplified game design software such as \nLOGO (Kafai, 1995 ), Gamestar Mechanic (An, 2016 ), Kodu \n(Akcaoglu, 2014; DeVane et al., 2016) or Scratch Studio (Ke, 2014; \nLi, 2010, 2012). Although not a game engine by definition, some \nother educators have experimented with Minecraft: Education \nEdition as a design-based teaching tool (Craft, 2016 ; S\u00e1ez-L\u00f3pez \net al., 2015). Given the short amount of time, the students\u2019 role in \nusing Unity 3D was limited to building 3D environments and did \nnot involve the coding necessary to build the finished virtual reality \nprogram. Instead, I personally performed all of the necessary \ncomputer coding and design required to build the final program.\nThis experiment was conducted as a component of a third-year \ncourse offered at Y ork University, Toronto, Canada. The course \nexamines urbanism in the Roman world, the economic relation \nbetween cities and the countryside, and public spaces within the \nRoman city. There were 45 students enrolled in the course, which \nconsisted of one weekly two-hour lecture and two one-hour \ntutorials (one for each half of the class). Over the course of six \nweeks, the experiment was administered to the class in the form of \na graded group assignment, in which the class was split into ten \ngroups and each group was assigned a generic Roman building to \nresearch. These included: a temple, portico, triumphal arch, \naqueduct, bath complex, basilica, macellum, elite house, purpose-\nbuilt brothel and a tavern.\nTheir task for the first three weeks was to conduct research on \ntheir respective public buildings, which involved both general \nreadings about their building type and others that discussed \nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S2058631022000277 Published online by Cambridge University Press", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3461, "end_char_idx": 7473, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f059913c-1b1f-49c6-9bae-2234a9366428": {"__data__": {"id_": "f059913c-1b1f-49c6-9bae-2234a9366428", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58bc78b4-a2a7-48d8-b360-011c37362262", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "hash": "55ca4104d8ccc1df9f1ac03e1af59eeac06d49ae4264a2a8723dd3d21bfd78ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c2653dc-8fa1-436c-b65a-1dd8df24265a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7256b81ad9aa62cf8b48b40b0f1ba39ecb525f6036c3bcfd72f4e3a2fd13286b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "18 Harrison Forsyth\nparticular examples. This initial research stage of the assignment \nwas specifically designed to ensure that students properly integrated \ncourse content into their 3D creations. Once this stage was \ncomplete, the students would each be responsible for constructing \na public building designed for a fictional Roman town in North \nWest Europe, recently integrated into the Empire, and to have once \nbeen a hotbed of Druidic resistance. This way the students were not \njust to create generic structures, but ones that were appropriate to \nthe local climate and political conditions.\nDuring the fourth week, the students received a four-hour crash \ncourse in the Unity 3D game design engine. Each group was \nallowed the use of one computer that was loaded with both the \nUnity 3D game engine and the Rome Fantasy Pack asset package \ndesigned by Quantum Theory (http://www.qt-ent.com). This asset \npackage contained a number of prefabricated architectural \ncomponents, including walls, columns, pavement, floors, ceilings, \nroofs, small objects, statues, furniture and numerous textures. \nDuring this session the students were taught how to manipulate \nprefabricated game objects, use materials, textures and lighting to \nbuild 3D renditions of their assigned public buildings, a process \nmuch akin to building with LEGO pieces.\nAfter the students were instructed in the use of the software, \nthey spent the rest of the initial session working on their buildings \nand spent the following two tutorial sessions continuing their \ngroup work as well as additional work outside of class. Once the 3D \nbuildings were completed, the individual files were consolidated \nand arranged in the form of a Roman city centre. I then built them \ninto a virtual reality program that allowed the students to explore \nand discuss their respective buildings in VR during in-class group \npresentations. During these presentations, students were allowed to \ntake turns using a single VR headset to explore the buildings in the \nRoman city they had collectively built, discussing their research \nassignments as the rest of the class viewed vicariously via a 2D \nprojection. Along with the in-class presentations, each student was \nrequired to submit individual reports on the process of creating \ntheir structure. Each report included the following points of \ndiscussion: structure type, design decisions, challenges and \ntechnical recommendations. Since this was also the first assignment \nof the term, it was one aimed at \u2018scene-setting\u2019 the big debates and \nthemes relating to Roman Urbanism before they engaged with \nmore abstract material and concepts of the course. As a result, the \nassessment regime later in the course was not testing the retention \nof factual data about architecture by means of multiple-choice \nquizzes and the like. Instead, assessment was essay-based, which \ndoes not lend itself well to quantification.\nFor these reasons, the results of this experiment relied heavily \nupon these anonymised response papers, of which 17/45 were \nauthorised for use in this study. The data from these responses will \nbe used to supplement discussion about some of the individual \nbuildings the groups produced, highlighting some of the successes \nand challenges the groups experienced during the design process. \nWhile this article will not be extensive enough to discuss every one \nof the students\u2019 creations, I have chosen to focus on designs in \nwhich the students experienced the most technical challenges. In \naddition to these individual responses and the 3D buildings \nproduced during this experiment, student comments from the final \ncourse evaluations of the Fall 2018 term will be examined to explore \nstudent dispositions toward the use of game design and VR \ntechnology in the classroom and possible improvements for \nsubsequent iterations of the same assignment in the future.\nResults\nFollowing the Unity 3D tutorial and in-class design sessions, all of \nthe assigned public buildings were arranged together to form the \ncivic centre of a fictitious Roman frontier city of the students\u2019 own \ndesign (Figure 1).

In \nthis respect, certain architectural elements commonly associated \nwith generic Roman public buildings were not available and the \nstudents had to adapt, in some cases limiting their ability to recreate \nevery architectural aspect of their assigned structures.\nIn addition, 16 students remarked that they would have \nbenefitted if more time had been devoted to the design sessions, \nwhich were limited to six hours over the course of three weeks. It \nwas clear from the outset that the steep learning curve of Unity 3D \ncould negatively impact the experiment. One student wrote \u2018I spoke \nto my friend whose degree is in video game design, and he told me \nhe could have done what we did in over six hours, in just thirty \nminutes. The difference in knowledge of the program is that \nimportant\u2019 . Despite the steep learning curve of the Unity 3D game \nengine, some of the students acknowledged incremental \nimprovement in their proficiency with the program over sessions. \nOne student wrote \u2018Once we were able to develop a basic degree of \ncompetence in Unity, we found the program quite intuitive and \nuser friendly\u2019 . Another student from the group that constructed the \ntriumphal arch also noted that \u2018The more we worked on our \nproject, the less challenging it became navigating through the \nprogram. At first it seemed very confusing, but we eventually got \nthe hang of it to create a successful arch\u2019 . Although a number of the \ngroups found the complexity of the Unity 3D engine to be \nchallenging, there was significant evidence of incremental \nimprovement over the course of the six-hour design session.\nA number of the students also found it difficult to align and \nconnect different architectural pieces in order to build a seamless \nbuilding. In a number of the finished buildings students would \nsometimes overlap architectural pieces, but otherwise their finished \nstructures were symmetrical and the architectural components fit \ntogether nicely. It seems as though alignment of architectural pieces \nwas simply time-consuming for the students and not a technical \nissue. This issue, moreover, could have easily been resolved if the \nstudents had used the \u2018vertex snapping\u2019 function, a function which \nI forgot to include in the Unity 3D tutorial.\nDespite these general challenges, none of the students found it \nimpossible to complete the task of building their structure in Unity \n3D and they were able to adapt to the challenges they experienced \nin their respective groups. Nevertheless, the learning curve \nassociated with the Unity 3D game engine was one of the most \ndaunting challenges the students had to face. Despite these \ncommon challenges, a number of the groups also demonstrated \nskills and design elements that exceeded the expectations of the \nexperiment. Some of the finished 3D public buildings illustrate the \nstudents\u2019 design process, the challenges they experienced, and the \nways in which the students overcame these challenges, in some \ncases exceeding the expectations of the experiment.\nThe group that was tasked with constructing the temple in the \nfictional city, for example, was able to integrate the research and \ndesign components of the assignment to good effect. The student \nresponse paper outlining the research and design process of the \ntemple in the virtual city demonstrated a basic understanding of \ngeneric Roman temple styles, including prostyle, hexastyle, and \npseudoperipteral architectural elements. The finished 3D temple \nthat this group constructed reflects this research to a certain extent \n(Figure 3), but the students appear to have misinterpreted some \nspecific architectural elements. Concerning the \u2018design decision\u2019 \nbehind their temple, the student response claims \u2018Our [sic] is a \nprostyle-hexastyle, meaning we have columns, specifically six, in \nfront of our cella of our temple\u2019 . Upon inspection of the temple the \ngroup constructed, the group had, instead, constructed a hybrid \ntetrastyle-peripteral temple, with four columns along its fa\u00e7ade \ninstead of six. It seems, therefore, that rather than replicating the \narchitecture of an existing Roman temple, they ended up creating a \ntypology of their own.

For the temple podium and \narchitrave, for example, the students created primitive game objects \n(in this case basic cubes and rectangles) onto which they applied \ntextures and materials that were included in the asset package. The \nasset package lacked certain architectural features, such as a temple \npodium or architrave, so the students met this challenge by creating \na simple object and giving it a texture. This is one example of a way in \nwhich the students compensated for the limits of the architectural \nfeatures offered by the asset package. Since this was a design \ntechnique that was only covered briefly during the Unity 3D \nintroduction session, the students in this group went beyond the \nbasic expectations of the design element of this experiment (i.e., to \ndesign Roman public buildings using prefabricated objects from the \nasset package). In terms of efficacy, this group succeeded in designing \na temple that reflected a general understanding of Roman religious \narchitecture and although there was a limited misunderstanding of \ncertain architectural forms, in this case the difference between \ntetrastyle and hexastyle temples, these mistakes could easily be \nremedied through typical avenues of correction or feedback.\nThe students tasked with building the triumphal arch \ndemonstrated a similar level of competence both in terms of the \nresearch and design process of their structure. The triumphal arch \nwas perhaps one of the more difficult structures to build using the \nRome Fantasy Pack asset package, especially since there were few \nprefabricated architectural components explicitly designed to build \na triumphal arch. In order to accomplish this goal, the students \nbuilt the basic elements of the arch (the piers and entablature) by \ncreating primitive objects (rectangular cubes) of their own design, \nthen adding prefabricated decorative elements, textures, and \narchitectural components from the asset package (Figure 4).\nThe student response papers submitted by the group that was \nassigned the triumphal arch demonstrated a basic understanding of \nthe cultural significance and architecture of Roman triumphal \narches. None of the response papers indicated that a particular, real \nlife, triumphal arch served as a prototype for the arch they created. \nMuch like the group that was assigned the temple, however, it \nseems as though the students created a hybridised triumphal arch \nequally influenced by both the Arch of Titus and the Arch of \nConstantine. On the one hand, the students chose to build a single \narch of roughly the same scale as the Arch of Titus and, following \nthe Arch of Constantine, included statue figures at the top of each \nside. The students were clearly engaging with and learning from \nreal life examples and ended up creating a generic building with \nhybridised elements.\nThe group that was responsible for the triumphal arch did, \nhowever, have some issues connecting research content with the \nFigure 3.

For example, the students from \nthis group decided that \u2018In AD 60\u2026the Emperor married a woman \nfrom the town and an arch was dedicated to them and their \nmarriage\u2019 . First and most obviously, the Emperor Nero was already \nmarried to Claudia Octavia in 60 CE and triumphal arches were \nnever constructed to celebrate an emperor\u2019s marriage, let alone to a \nwoman from a Gallic frontier town. The rationale for their \nstructure, therefore, contained some anachronisms. Perhaps the \nstudents might have better understood the historical context of \ntriumphal arches by researching a specific example in which the \nreason for construction is well known. Other groups had less \ntrouble integrating research content into their designs, however.\nThe group that was assigned to construct the brothel was \nextremely effective in its design and was able to incorporate design \ndecisions using the Lupanar at Pompeii as a design influence. The \nstudents specifically refer to this decision, indicating their intention \nto construct a purpose-built brothel. One student in this group \nwrote \u2018one consistency we see throughout the various records of \npurpose-built brothels is the placement of erotic art and graffiti. We \nknow for certain that there is one purpose-built brothel in Pompeii \ncalled [sic] Lupanar\u2019 . The design decisions of this group \ndemonstrated the most effective use of research material to \ninfluence their design. The students in this group ensured that their \ndesign included architectural criteria for the identification of \npurpose-built brothels outlined by Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, \nproviding a solid academic basis for their decisions (Wallace-\nHadrill, 1995, pp. 51\u201354). Then they proceeded to design a purpose-\nbuilt brothel that included masonry beds and explicit paintings of \nsexual scenes (Figure 5).\nSince the asset package did not include wall paintings depicting \nsexual imagery, the students were able to acquire images of wall \npaintings from the Lupanar in Pompeii and add them to image \npanes using the built-in functions of the Unity 3D engine. In order \nto accomplish this, the group required some additional instruction \nduring the Unity 3D introduction session, but the students were \nable to add their own textures after a quick explanation. After the \nerotic paintings were added to the interior, the students responsible \nfor the purpose-built brothel then went a step further to include a \npainting of Priapus on the exterior wall of the brothel, indicating \nthe function of the building as a purpose-built brothel (Figure 6). \nThe students also had some difficulty including masonry beds due \nto the limited number of prefabricated items in the asset package. \nThe students viewed this, in addition to the lack of explicit wall \npaintings in the asset package, as their biggest challenge. Like other \ngroups, however, they overcame these challenges by creating \nprimitive objects (usually cubes or square panes) and applying \nother textures and images to them.

Moreover, \nthe students provided a rationale for the design decisions that was \nbased on relevant scholarship, demonstrating a good balance \nbetween research and design.\nWhile all of the examples above demonstrate that the students \nwho experienced technical challenges were more than capable of \nsolving them, some groups were not as successful at fulfilling the \nresearch requirements of the assignment. In particular, the group \nthat was assigned to build a public portico completely ignored the \nresearch component of the assignment and instead built what looks \nlike a temple fa\u00e7ade. A quick Google search of \u2018Roman portico\u2019 \nresults in images of the porch of the Pantheon at Rome, which the \nstudents in this group clearly used as inspiration. There also \nappears to be confusion between the definition of a public portico \nand temple portico (architectural component) in the response \nwritten by students in this group. Despite the fact that all of the \ngroups were successful in using the Unity 3D engine to meet the \ntechnical requirements of this assignment, the \u2018portico\u2019 designed \nfor the virtual Roman city serves as an example of what happens \nwhen the research component of the assignment is completely \nignored. Luckily, this was the only case in which this happened \nduring the experiment. In this case, the students were supposed to \nbuild a public portico but instead built a temple fa\u00e7ade (Figure 7).\nOf the 45 students enrolled in the class, 30 of them provided \nwritten feedback when they filled out course evaluation sheets at \nthe end of the term. Of the 30 respondents, 22 of them gave \nfeedback concerning the Virtual City Project. Much of the feedback \nreiterates some of the technical difficulties the students experienced \nduring their design process, but many of the responses also \nillustrate the extent to which the students found the assignment \nenjoyable. When asked to provide suggestions to improve the \ncourse, seven students gave the following feedback concerning the \nVirtual City Project:\n\u2018The virtual assignment would have benefitted from having \nmore in class time as the group assignment required the use \nof only one device. \u2019\n\u2018Less focus on the virtual reality technology in the individual \nreport assessment. \u2019\n\u2018To continue to upgrade the Unity program, since it was an \nexcellent experience. To make it easier to access content, \nintroductory tutorials and actual building of the structure. \u2019\n\u2018The virtual reality assignment perhaps could\u2019ve used another \nweek of in class time, and perhaps placing more emphasis on \nthe ideas behind your design, or perhaps a graded mini-essay \nfor your choices for that design. \u2019\n\u2018Individual report (VR Project) more focused on course \ncontent rather than evaluating technology \u2013 never used \nb e f o r e .\u2019\n\u2018I would definitely suggest keeping the virtual city assignment \nas that was probably the most fun assignment I have done \nduring my time at university. \u2019\n\u2018The Virtual City Project was a fantastic idea that I enjoyed \nvery much. However, unless you were familiar with the Unity \nsoftware already, the project proved very challenging. A \nsignificant amount of personal time was needed to construct \na viable, architecturally sound structure because the software \ninherently demanded a steep learning curve (especially for a \nhistory student). Perhaps more in-class time (i.e., maybe one \nmore tutorial?) would have benefitted greatly\u2026That said, I \nfeel it was valuable and being able to virtually see how a \nRoman city is constructed was very fulfilling and I \nrecommend doing the project again. Just a little more in-class \nhelp would be very beneficial. \u2019\nBased on this feedback, the students addressed many of the same \nissues that were mentioned in the personal response essays, most \nnotably the need for more time for in-class design sessions and the \ndifficulties of group work. Other suggestions indicate that the \nstudents found the Unity 3D engine difficult to learn, warranting \nmore accessible tutorial material or longer instructional sessions.

It was fun \ngetting hands-on in creating the structure. \u2019\n\u2018The virtual city was a good idea for learning. \u2019\n\u2018The virtual city project was a stimulating and interesting \nchange for a history course and provided a new and exciting \nway of learning and applying knowledge. \u2019\n\u2018The Unity program shows great promise in combination of \ntechnology and history!\u2019\n\u2018The virtual reality assignment was very fun and interesting \nand a great way to learn the content. \u2019\n\u2018The virtual reality aspect was cool but it was difficult to do as \na group assignment because only one person could use the \nprogram, maybe if it was with partners it could work better. \nNot everyone got a chance to use the program, the program \nwas also very time consuming to create the structure. Overall \nit was an interesting aspect of the course. \u2019\n\u2018The virtual reality aspect made the course very interesting. \u2019\n\u2018The virtual city project was creative and an engaging way of \nexploring Roman architecture. \u2019\n\u2018The first time in course history, we were able to use virtual \nreality as another segue into learning ancient Roman history \nand how this was used as an actual assignment to help \nstimulate my learning. We were in groups for this assignment \nand it was a really fun time. \u2019\n\u2018The Virtual Reality assignment worked quite well overall, \ngenerally speaking. The implementation and the reliance on \ngroup work comes with its usual drawbacks since humans are \na mysterious beast, and the actual software we used to design \nour structures wasn\u2019t as extensive as I would have liked. I \nenjoyed the endgame aspect where all the groups could enjoy \nthe structures they made. \u2019\n\u2018 As the first group to be part of the virtual reality class of this \ncourse, I believe that was an exceptional project that would \nallow us to have fun as well as learn and be part of the building \nprocess of Ancient Rome. There were aspects of the course \nthat the prof made humorous and that made for fun and \ninteractive aspects of the course. \u2019\n\u2018The virtual reality project was very interesting and I feel like \nit should be integrated as a yearly part of this course. \u2019\n\u2018Greatly enjoyed the course, and would recommend it to \nanyone! The virtual reality assignment was definitely a \nunique portion to the course, and I\u2019 d love to see its use in \nother courses and other parts in history in general. The \norganization of the course I found very concise, with \neverything being well structured in terms of material and \nlectures. \u2019\n\u2018Having Harrison come in to help during VR classes was \nhelpful. \u2019\nAside from one comment in which a student wrote that the Virtual \nCity Project was \u2018not fleshed out enough to be worthwhile\u2019 , the \nother comments indicate that the students enjoyed the Virtual City \nProject.

A \nnumber of previous studies involving constructionist teaching \napproaches have noted low levels of content integration among \nstudents tasked with designing computer learning games (An, 2016; \nCraft, 2016; Kafai, 1995 ; Kafai et al ., 1998; Ke, 2014 ). In these \nprevious studies, however, the subjects were typically children or \nteenagers who had not developed post-secondary level research \nskills. Although some of the students involved in the Virtual City \nProject had difficulty integrating research content into their \nbuilding designs, these issues were minimal with only one of the ten \ngroups failing to meet this requirement.\nThe groups who built the temple and triumphal arch clearly \ndemonstrated that they had done diligent research on generic \nelements of their respective buildings, but their creations ended up \nincorporating hybridised architectural elements in configurations \nthat were uncommon or unheard of in the Roman world. \nNevertheless, both groups demonstrated familiarity with both \nspecific examples and generic aspects of their structure types. In \nthe worst case, the group tasked with building the public portico \ndid not successfully incorporate research content into their design \nat all. In the best case, however, the students assigned to design the \npurpose-built brothel made their design decisions based on their \nassigned readings and explained these decisions well in their report. \nIn conclusion, most of the groups were able to successfully create \npublic buildings that reflected good research on their assigned \nstructure type. The students in this study, therefore, demonstrated \nthat they were able to meet the technical requirements of the \nassignment and integrate research content into their creations.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S2058631022000277 Published online by Cambridge University Press", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3656, "end_char_idx": 6401, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "833f296d-39f8-4f94-9cad-b69ebfa96ba0": {"__data__": {"id_": "833f296d-39f8-4f94-9cad-b69ebfa96ba0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "147c84d0-7a17-431a-9abc-11a753b5504f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "hash": "64b82ed9c850d25d1e842bce4a9bd4be449d634ab31e6adcdc191c2ea1e4a939", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a374869-6b83-4980-88f1-29c1857dd7f5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "43c35f26dddf5886586edb1af05b89ebc2772fb25dfd747c79ba00edba5c73af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "24 Harrison Forsyth\nIn addition, course evaluation feedback indicates that the \nstudents showed a generally positive disposition toward both the \ndesign component of the assignment and the general course \ncontent. If anything, the results of the Virtual City Project have \ndemonstrated that the students were clearly capable of using this \ntechnology to good effect and subsequent iterations of this \nassignment along with more feedback will allow for incremental \nimprovement. It is hard to say, however, whether this approach is \nbetter for knowledge retention than the traditional research-based \nproject typically assigned to students of this course. Traditionally, \nstudents in this course complete a group assignment in which they \ngive group presentations on a specific public building from the \nRoman world (e.g., the Macellum of Pompeii, the Aqua Claudia, or \nthe Basilica Julia), but the Virtual City Project did not allow for \nsuch specificity, especially due to the generic nature of the \narchitectural pieces in the asset package and the steep learning \ncurve of the Unity 3D software. This highlights the main limitation \nof this design-based teaching experiment, which is to say that \nstudents could only build generic representations of the structures \nthey were assigned. The design element of the Virtual City Project \ncame at the expense of time that could have been devoted to case \nspecific research of Roman urban architecture. One possible \nsolution to this would be to use a simpler design-based platform \nsuch as Minecraft: Education Edition, which other scholars have \nused to good effect for design-based learning in the classroom \n(Craft, 2016; S\u00e1ez-L\u00f3pez et al ., 2015). This would allow more \nin-class time to be allocated to learning historical content rather \nthan new technical skills. That being said, having the class learn the \nbasics of the Unity 3D software also introduced liberal arts students \nto transferable technical skills often limited to computer science \ncourses. For many institutions that value interdisciplinary \napproaches to teaching and learning, the mixture of liberal arts and \ncomputer science skills is one of the benefits of this assignment that \nwould be diluted by a shift to a more simplified, play-based, \niteration of this assignment. For this last reason specifically, the \nUnity 3D engine offers students engaged in design-based learning \nthe maximum benefit of such an assignment, despite its steep \nlearning curve.\nIn future iterations of this assignment, it would be interesting to \nadd computer programming and coding elements to the design \nprocess, allowing students to build their own programs for \nvisualising, manipulating and exploring environments in 3D space. \nWhile there is currently a shortfall in computer coding literacy \namong the general university population, particularly in the liberal \narts, it will not be long before proficiency in computer coding is a \ncommon skill. Scholars of computer and behavioural science have \ndetermined that children are entirely capable of learning to code at \nyoung ages and that coding provides cognitive benefits especially in \nterms of enhancing problem solving skills (Bers, 2016 ; Bers et al ., \n2019; Harel, 1991; Kafai et al ., 2014; Papert, 1980). In recent years, \nmoreover, a number of countries across the world have begun to \nimplement coding in public school curricula, including my home \nprovince of Ontario, Canada. These developments will certainly \nreduce the amount of time necessary to teach students how to use \ngame design software such as Unity 3D in future years.\nDespite the current limitations, the students involved in the \nVirtual City Project in the Fall term of 2018 were successful in \nbuilding a virtual Roman city using Unity 3D and they enjoyed \ndoing it. As might be expected, the students encountered some \ntechnical challenges, but these challenges did not prevent the \nstudents from accomplishing the goals of the assignment. Taking \nwhat has been learned from this initial experiment into \nconsideration, there are hopes to administer the assignment the \nnext time this course is taught. As far as efficacy is concerned, this \nexperiment most definitely supports the constructionist teaching \napproach and, most importantly, it leaves room for further \ninvestigation and experimentation. In future iterations of this \nassignment, the students should keep using the Unity 3D engine \ndespite its steep learning curve. It affords the students room to \nexceed the basic expectations of the assignment as a number of the \ngroups demonstrated in the Virtual City Project. With more time \nallocated to learning the software many of the technical challenges \nthe students faced can be addressed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4745, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a374869-6b83-4980-88f1-29c1857dd7f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a374869-6b83-4980-88f1-29c1857dd7f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "147c84d0-7a17-431a-9abc-11a753b5504f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "hash": "64b82ed9c850d25d1e842bce4a9bd4be449d634ab31e6adcdc191c2ea1e4a939", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "833f296d-39f8-4f94-9cad-b69ebfa96ba0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_path": "E:\\Histarch3D\\Projects\\Forsyth-Simple-Offline-Rag\\AI_RAG\\data\\building-a-virtual-roman-city-teaching-history-through-video-game-design.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2124238, "creation_date": "2025-08-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-04"}, "hash": "1f35ab9d489c68dd8429ad79edf39b47f08726ebfacd5f0f94664ee002c2afb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As might be expected, the students encountered some \ntechnical challenges, but these challenges did not prevent the \nstudents from accomplishing the goals of the assignment.

The issue of content integration \ncould also be remedied by assessment of the research component of \neach assignment followed by necessary corrections before the \nstudents begin designing their structures.\nWith a growing corpus of literature on the positive effects and \nuses of video gaming technology, we will definitely see more of it in \nclassrooms and workplaces around the world. For example, Jane \nMcGonigal\u2019s book Reality is Broken successfully illustrates the ways \nin which video games and the principles behind their design can \nmake the world a better place (McGonigal, 2011). Also Squire et al. \n(2008), Christensen and Machado (2010) and Rogers (2011) provide \nadditional case studies that exemplify the use of video games as a \nteaching tool in the classroom. Even in the fields of the liberal arts, \nscholars have been long discussing the benefits of VR and AR \ntechnologies for research and teaching, both of which share a \nsymbiotic relationship with video game design software (Cargill, \n2009; Hanson and Shelton, 2008 ; Roth and Fisher, 2019 ; Sanders, \n2014; Schrader and Bastiaens, 2012 ; Slater, 2009 ). Hopefully this \narticle has inspired others to use game design technologies as a tool \nfor teaching or, at the very least, persuaded those who are sceptical \nto read further and consider the massive potential of this emerging \ndigital humanities application.\nHarrison Forsyth is currently a PhD candidate in the History department at \nY ork University in Toronto, Canada where he teaches and conducts research. \nWhile his primary research focuses on Latin epigraphy in the Roman \nprovince of Lusitania, he has extensive experience conducting archaeological \nfieldwork in Spain and Italy, with a focus on designing virtual reality \nsimulations for training, research, and archaeological preservation. Harrison \nalso has extensive teaching experience at Y ork University, where he has \nhelped incorporate elements of virtual reality and video game design into the \nClassical Studies curriculum. He also holds a position as Principal \nInvestigator at Durham College in Oshawa, Ontario. There he leads applied \nresearch projects geared towards the development of virtual reality research \nsolutions for tech and industrial clients in the private sector.\nReferences\nAkcaoglu M (2014) Learning problem-solving through making games at the \ngame design and learning summer program.
